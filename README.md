# BlinkOS

BlinkOS is a hobby operating system made for fun and education. Started in late 2022, BlinkOS was originally both the kernel and the userspace code; However I have since split the two (kind of). BlinkOS runs on the Light kernel which is tailored to run BlinkOS. BlinkOS will probably never have any c++ code, however I may introduce some rust and possibly other languages in the future.

BlinkOS is currently in a very early stage of development, and probably wont be ready for any sort of use (maybe never) for a long time.
