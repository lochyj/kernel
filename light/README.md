# Light

Light is the name for the kernel that runs BlinkOS. It is a monolithic kernel written in c and asm. It currently only supports x86 but i plant to support some sort of aarch and possibly x86_64 / aarch64 in the future.

## Building

Use the makefile in the home directory of the BlinkOS repo to build Light.

## Plans

I currently have plans to re-write parts of the kernel to be completely original code.
I have no clue when this will happen but it will happen eventually.

## Restructure

I recently restructured (insert commit) the kernel to be similar in layout to the linux kernel, simply because its a nice structure.
